## Introduction
 Hello my name Delilah Aguilar and I go by she/her prounouns. I'm in 10th grade and I go to Chatsworth Charter Highschool. I'm 15 years old and my birthday is December 10th. I have one tuxedo cat named Phoebe Cilantro and she turned 1 year old this past April. I'm an only child and some things I like to do on my free time is build legos and go shopping. 

Some academic goals I have for this school year is being able to comprehend every subject successfully and maintain good grades in every class. Some expectations I have for this class is to fully understand coding and every Unit we go through. Most importantly I hope to pass all the AP's I'm taking. 

Some things I heavily enjoy are watching shows/movies, hanging out with friends, going to concerts, and traveling. Some of my favorite shows are Criminal Minds, Modern Family, and How I Met Your Mother. I typically enjoy watching Rom-Coms, Comedy, Horror, and Thriller movies. Although some of my favorite animated movies are Despicable ME and Ratatouille.  One of my favorite things I like to do on my free time is hang out with friends and find new food places to try or going new places. One of my favorite concerts I've gone to is Bruno Mars. My favorite place I love to travel to is Guatemala.
